My solution to Advent of Code 2020 in TypeScript https://adventofcode.com/2020

## Running

```bash
npm start -- {day} {part}
```

To run day 1, part 1 type `npm start -- 1 1`.

## Template for a new day's challenges

```bash
npm run plop
```

When prompted, type in the day number, e.g. `2`. The template files for both
parts of the day will be created in the `./src/day2` directory.
